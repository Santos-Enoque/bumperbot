CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findbumperbot_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "bumperbot_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "bumperbot_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

    bumperbot_msgsConfig.cmake
    bumperbot_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "bumperbot_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "bumperbot_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "bumperbot_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
